          <p>Dear Roadrunners,</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to offer my candidacy as an Affiliate Faculty member for the Computer Information Systems department. Here are a few reasons I'm uniquely qualified for this position:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>I have over a decade of experience developing software professionally. I worked for and with 10-person start-ups, 90,000-person enterprises, and everything in between.</li>
              <li>I've taught software development for over 5 years. In that time, I've successfully helped over 700 career-changers start new careers in software development.</li>
              <li>I'm experienced with traditional academic environments and know what it takes to be successful in them. I was a Summa Cum Laude graduate of the CIS department and the recipient of the Outstanding Student Award from Metro in 2012. I also hold a master's degree from CU Boulder's Engineering Management program with a 3.9 GPA.</li>
            </ul>          
          </p>
          <p>I look forward to discussing my qualifications with you further!</p>
          <p>Sincerely, Kyle</p>
